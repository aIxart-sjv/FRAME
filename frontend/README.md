# FRAME frontend (Phase 8)

A single-page console for demonstrating the FRAME pipeline end to end:
upload a Sentinel-2 L2A GeoTIFF, run FRAME, and inspect the SR-derived
output, its TTA stability diagnostic, and an NDVI demonstration
— entirely through the real FastAPI backend (`frame/api/`), with no
Python imported into the browser.

## Running it

Requires the FRAME API running first (see `frame/api/README.md`):

```bash
# terminal 1 -- backend
sen2sr_venv/bin/uvicorn frame.api.app:app --port 8000

# terminal 2 -- frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed `http://localhost:5173` URL.

## Backend URL configuration

The frontend never hard-codes a backend host. It reads `VITE_FRAME_API_URL`
at build/dev time (see `src/api/client.ts`), defaulting to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000` if unset — the backend's own default port. To point
at a different backend:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local: VITE_FRAME_API_URL=http://your-host:8000
```

The backend's own CORS configuration (`FRAME_API_CORS_ORIGINS`, see
`frame/api/README.md`) must list the frontend's origin — the backend's
default already includes `http://localhost:5173`.

## Supported input

Sentinel-2 L2A GeoTIFFs with exactly the four bands this prototype's
backend supports: **B04, B03, B02, B08** (order-independent), of **any height
and width** up to the backend's pixel cap (larger scenes are tiled; see
`docs/TILING.md`), with an embedded CRS. This is the only path the API validates
end to end — see `frame/api/README.md`'s "Scope" note. Uploading anything
else (wrong bands, no CRS, a non-GeoTIFF file, a scene with no valid pixel, or
a "Pixel values" setting the file's values contradict) is rejected by
the backend with a clear message, shown inline rather than as a crash.
Set **Pixel values** to match the file (Raw digital number, or Reflectance (0–1));
changing it re-validates the file.

## User workflow

1. **Upload** a GeoTIFF — it is validated immediately (`POST /upload`, no
   SR run yet) and its metadata (dimensions, resolution, bands, CRS)
   appears as the input preview.
2. **Run FRAME** — a single explicit action that fires `POST /sr/run`.
   The pipeline-stage indicator reflects the two real HTTP requests this
   prototype actually makes (upload, then the single synchronous SR run)
   — it does not fabricate a step-by-step progress percentage, since the
   backend itself doesn't report one (preprocessing, the frozen SR model,
   and the uncertainty ensemble all execute inside that one request).
3. **Overview** tab — a comparison slider between the native 10 m input
   and the **SR-derived product — 2.5 m pixel grid**.
4. **Stability** tab — the **TTA stability — reconstruction-variation
   diagnostic** map, toggleable between a standalone heatmap and an SR-image
   overlay whose opacity is modulated by the value itself (so unstable
   regions are visually obvious, not a binary mask), plus the real
   distribution statistics from the API response. The tab states that the
   signal is uncalibrated and that FRAME's own validation found it only
   weakly associated with error (about as much as image texture), so it is
   to be inspected, not read as a reliability score.
5. **NDVI** tab — a **demonstration** (it says so on the tab): triggers `POST /analysis/ndvi` on demand, then shows the
   native NDVI, SR-derived NDVI, their absolute difference, and the
   measured comparison/uncertainty-relationship statistics — all numbers
   and rasters come from the backend; nothing is recomputed in the
   browser.
6. **Metadata** tab — the full reproducibility record (model, seed, TTA
   transforms, device, inference time, CRS, valid-pixel coverage,
   self-consistency numbers).
7. **Downloads** (sidebar, always visible once a result exists) — the SR
   GeoTIFF, uncertainty GeoTIFF, NDVI GeoTIFFs, and the raw JSON result/
   analysis, each a real file from the backend.

## Terminology / scientific caveats

This app repeats, rather than paraphrases, the backend's own fixed
language (`src/constants/terminology.ts` mirrors `frame/api/schemas.py`):

- The SR output is always **"SR-derived product — 2.5 m pixel grid"** —
  never "native 2.5 m Sentinel-2" or a "true 2.5 m image."
- The stability signal is always **"TTA stability — reconstruction-variation
  diagnostic"** (before Phase 8: "relative model-stability uncertainty") —
  never a calibrated confidence, probability of error or reliability score.
- LAM (upstream sensitivity/explainability) is never called
  "uncertainty," and is not exposed by any view in this app.
- NDVI agreement between the native and SR grids demonstrates internal
  consistency, not proof of physical accuracy, and the NDVI view is a
  demonstration, not evidence of a downstream advantage — stated on the NDVI
  tab using the backend's own `scientific_caveats` plus the fixed
  `NDVI_DEMONSTRATION_NOTE`.

`frame/tests/test_api_terminology.py` (backend) and
`src/__tests__/terminology.test.tsx` (frontend) both enforce these
structurally, independent of each other.

## Visualization notes

The backend returns GeoTIFFs, not preview images. This app decodes them
client-side with the `geotiff` npm package (the browser equivalent of the
backend's own `rasterio` reads) and renders them to `<canvas>` with a
percentile stretch — a display transform only, the same category as the
backend's own `normalize_for_visualization` (`frame/uncertainty/README.md`).
No NDVI, uncertainty statistic, or resampling is computed in the browser —
see `src/lib/geotiff.ts`, `src/lib/colormap.ts`, and `src/lib/raster.ts`
for exactly where that line is drawn.

## Reduced-motion behavior

The interface includes a restrained ambient satellite/starfield animation
(`src/components/atmosphere/SatelliteField.tsx`) — a couple of small
satellites drifting across the hero area, and a faint static-feeling
starfield elsewhere. It respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
(`src/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts`): with that OS-level preference set, the
canvas renders one static frame instead of running a
`requestAnimationFrame` loop, and every CSS transition/animation
elsewhere in the app collapses to near-zero duration
(`src/styles/global.css`'s `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`
block). None of this motion ever blocks interaction — it is `aria-hidden`
and `pointer-events: none` throughout.

## Development / build commands

```bash
npm run dev         # start the Vite dev server
npm run build       # tsc -b && vite build -- production build
npm run preview     # preview the production build locally
npm run test        # run the Vitest suite once
npm run test:watch  # run Vitest in watch mode
npm run lint        # oxlint
```

## What this app deliberately does not do

- No basemap, map tiles, or AOI-driven imagery fetch — `POST /aoi/preview`
  only validates a request shape, it doesn't fetch real Sentinel-2 scenes
  (see `frame/api/README.md`); this app doesn't imply otherwise.
- No new scientific computation anywhere in the browser — every number
  and raster shown comes from a `frame/api/` response.
- No authentication, database, or job queue — this mirrors the backend's
  own prototype scope (`frame/api/README.md`'s "Prototype behavior").
